github (for those in a hurry, so tldr)
These are bash commands, cause thats what i use, but it could be different in other shells. Probably not that differet though

1: sign up for github
2: settings part a(credentials)
3: settings part b(create remote repo)
   b1 - if working in a group, you might want to have a "development" branch
4: download software( i use git bash, the desktop app works but its harder to tell what went wrong if something does through the gui app)
5: local settings -git needs your credentials locally
6: initialize your repository

how git works:
your program -> add files to the changelist (tracking)-> commit your changes to the local repo -> push your changes to the remote branch


so really this means at the start, 4 commands are relevant (maybe 4 1/2 )
(quotation marks mine)

"git init" intializes the repository
"git add" adds files to tracking, so you can commit them later
"git commit" commits to local branch.
"git push[some option]" pushes the commited files to the remote reopsitory (specifically, the branch you specify)
"git push origin master" pushes your commit to the repository you cloned the repo from, specifically the master branch.

on the command line side of things the relevant navigation stuff is
cd (diectory name) - moves you to that directory
ls -lists the files in the current directory

I think of it like a series of rooms. You walk into a room, you look around, see a door labeled desktop, 
then walk though that door and maybe look around again. Eventually, you find your way to the room with the file you want in it.
